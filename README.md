## Author(s)

## Project Description
This is an ALX project for creating binary trees. A binary tree is a type of DSA
that organizes data in a tree-like structure. 

### Objectives
By completing this project, we demonstrate:
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
